✨ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end machine learning application designed to solve a real-world problem: credit card fraud. It features a robust Python backend powered by Flask that serves a Scikit-learn model, coupled with a responsive and interactive frontend.

What sets this project apart is its integration with the Google Gemini API. When a transaction is flagged as fraudulent, the application can generate an AI-powered risk report, explaining the potential risks and providing clear, actionable steps for the user.

Note: This is a demonstration project. The V1-V28 features are anonymized, so the primary way to test the application is by using the provided "Sample Data" buttons.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 ML-Powered Predictions: Utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on a highly imbalanced dataset to classify transactions with high precision.

🖥️ Interactive Web UI: A clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS allows for seamless interaction on any device.

🤖 AI-Powered Risk Analysis: On detecting fraud, a user can generate an intelligent report from the Gemini API that provides context and recommended actions.

⚡ Real-Time API: A robust Flask API exposes the ML model's prediction capabilities over a /predict endpoint, responding with JSON.

📊 Data Preprocessing: Demonstrates key ML concepts like feature scaling (StandardScaler) and strategies for handling imbalanced data.

✅ Easy Demonstration: Includes "Normal" and "Fraud" sample data buttons to allow anyone (including recruiters!) to easily test and verify the model's functionality.

📈 Machine Learning Model
The core of this project is a Logistic Regression model trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Model: Logistic Regression was chosen as a strong, interpretable baseline.

Dataset: The model was trained on the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset, which contains 284,807 transactions, with only 492 (0.172%) being fraudulent.

Challenge: The extreme class imbalance makes 'accuracy' a misleading metric. Therefore, the model's performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, which are more suitable for this type of problem.

Performance on Test Data:

Precision (Fraud): 0.86 (When it predicts fraud, it's correct 86% of the time).

Recall (Fraud): 0.60 (It correctly identifies 60% of all actual frauds).

F1-Score (Fraud): 0.71 (A harmonic mean of Precision and Recall).
